# üßæ Rails Invoicing Application

A modern Rails 8.0.2 invoicing application built with PostgreSQL, Hotwire, Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with Claude Code MCP integration for an optimal development experience.

## üöÄ Features

- **Modern Rails Stack**: Rails 8.0.2 with Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) for SPA-like interactions
- **Solid Infrastructure**: Database-backed caching, job processing, and WebSockets (no Redis needed)
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS for modern, mobile-first UI
- **Production Ready**: Docker containerization with Kamal for zero-downtime deployments
- **AI-Enhanced Development**: Comprehensive MCP server integration for Claude Code
- **Security First**: Brakeman scanning, encrypted credentials, and comprehensive CI/CD

## üìã Requirements

- **Ruby**: 3.4.2
- **Rails**: 8.0.2
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 12+
- **Node.js**: 18+ (for asset compilation)
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment (optional)

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/andrzejsliwa/invoicing.git
cd invoicing

# Install dependencies and set up database
bin/setup

# Start the development server (Rails + Tailwind watcher)
bin/dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Manual Setup
If you prefer step-by-step setup:

```bash
# Install Ruby dependencies
bundle install

# Create and migrate databases
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate
bin/rails db:seed

# Start development server
bin/rails server

# In another terminal, start Tailwind CSS watcher
bin/rails tailwindcss:watch
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails 8.0.2 with MVC architecture
- **Frontend**: Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) with Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with multi-database configuration
- **Assets**: Propshaft pipeline with Importmap for JavaScript
- **Background Jobs**: Solid Queue (database-backed)
- **Caching**: Solid Cache (database-backed)
- **WebSockets**: Solid Cable (database-backed ActionCable)
- **Deployment**: Kamal with Docker containerization

### Database Architecture
The application uses multiple PostgreSQL databases:
- **Primary**: Main application data (invoices, customers, etc.)
- **Cache**: Solid Cache storage
- **Queue**: Background job processing
- **Cable**: WebSocket connections

```

## ü§ñ AI-Enhanced Development

This project includes comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for enhanced development with Claude Code:

### Available MCP Servers
1. **Rails MCP Server** - Access to Rails, Stimulus, Turbo, and Kamal guides
2. **GitHub MCP Server** - Repository management and GitHub integration
3. **HT MCP Server** - Terminal session management
4. **Browser MCP Server** - Web automation and testing
5. **Memory MCP Server** - Session persistence and context
6. **File System MCP Server** - Enhanced file operations
7. **Web Fetch MCP Server** - Web content retrieval

### Setup MCP Integration
```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Initialize in project
claude-code init

# Add Rails MCP server
claude-code mcp add rails-mcp-server
```

See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed MCP setup instructions.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Deployment with Kamal
```bash
# Initial setup (first deployment)
bin/kamal setup

# Deploy application
bin/kamal deploy

# Rollback to previous version
bin/kamal rollback

# Check application status
bin/kamal app status
```

### Docker Development
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t invoicing .

# Run with Docker Compose (if configured)
docker-compose up
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` files for different environments:

```bash
# .env.development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/invoicing_development
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=your_master_key_here

# .env.production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host/invoicing_production
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=your_production_master_key
```

### Credentials Management
```bash
# Edit credentials
bin/rails credentials:edit

# Edit environment-specific credentials
bin/rails credentials:edit --environment production
```
